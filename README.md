In electric cars, lithium-ion batteries are common because they can store a lot of energy, are relatively inexpensive, but still have some drawbacks such as their lifespan, safety and cost. These lifespans may be particularly brief in harsh weather. To help with this, battery thermal management system (BTMS) is used to control the temperature range of the battery. 
Most EVs prefer air cooling for that reason; itâ€™s cheaper and simpler than other methods. It examines how placing air-cooled Li-ion cells in staggered patterns improves heat management.

The main concern is comparing different configurations of the cell module for airflow through it and inlet when there is forced flow to see which way cools the battery better. A heat transfer analysis was carried out on both designs to determine an optimal design for a battery pack.

To verify model accuracy and performance under normal condition, single cell simulation was performed with thermal simulations over time run in parallel as well. The results were analyzed by considering parameters such as maximum temperature reached, rate of change in temperature, velocity, pressure and zones of air motion inside.
